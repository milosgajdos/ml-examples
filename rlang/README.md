# ML

This directory will contain a collection of examples of basic Machine Learning algorithms implementations in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Currently it only provides a simple [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) and [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) implementations, but hopefully when the time allows I'll be adding more algorithms.
