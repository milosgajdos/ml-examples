# About

This repo will [hopefully] contain a collection of examples of basic Machine Learning algorithms implemented in various programming languages.

Currently I'm learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), so the first examples will mostly be hacked in **Elixir**. I will hopefully be adding more examples in other programming languages.
