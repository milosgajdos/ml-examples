# About

This repo will [hopefully] contain a collection of examples of basic Machine Learning algorithms implemented in various programming languages.

Currently I'm learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/), so the first examples will mostly be hacked in either of these languages.
